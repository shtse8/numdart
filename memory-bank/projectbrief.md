# Project Brief: NumDart - A NumPy-like Package for Dart

## 1. Project Goal

To create a Dart package, tentatively named "NumDart", that provides
functionality similar to Python's NumPy library. The primary goals are:

- **API Compatibility:** Mimic NumPy's flexible and powerful API desig
 n where feasible.
- **Performance:** Strive for performance comparable to NumPy for core opera
 tions, especially within
   **Target Platform:** Initially focus on Flutter, with potential for future cross-platform support.

# 2. Core Requirements (Initial Focus)


-
* -ore Data Structure (`NdArray`):**
  - Multi-dimensional array representation.
  - Internal storage using Dart's `TypedData` for efficienc
- *   Management of shape, strides, and data types (`dtype`).
 
- **Basic Array Creation:** Functions like `array()`, `zeros()`, `ones()`, 
 `arange()`, `linspace()`.
- **Indexing and Slicing:** Support for integer indexing and range slicing, 
 handling NumPy conventions.
- **Element-wise Mathematical Operations:** Basic arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*
 `, `/`) and common math functions (`
   **Broadcasting:** Implementing NumPy's broadcasting rules for operations between arrays of different shapes.

# 3. Development Plan (Phased Approach)


-
* -asks:**
   
  - Design and implement the `NdArray` class using `TypedData`, shape/strides management).
  - Implement basic array creation functions.
  - Implement fundamental indexing and slicing logic.
- *   Set up a robust testing framework (`package:tes
   **Goal:** Establish a functional core array object.

    A[Design NdArray Core] -> B(Implement Shape/Strides);

    B --> D(mplement Creation Funcs);
    C --> D;
    D --> E(Implement Indexng/Slicing);

-
* -asks:**
   
  - Implement element-wise mathematical opera
  - Implement NumPy's broadcasting mechanism.
- *   Conduct initial performance analysis and benchmarkin
   **Goal:** Enable basic numerical computations on arrays.

```mermad
graph TD
    G[Implement Elem-wise Math]--> H(Basic Arithmetic);
    G --> I(Common Math Funcs);
    H --> J(mplement Broadcasting);
    I --> J;
   
``


-
* -asks:**
  - Package the library for Dart/Flutter.
  - Write documentation and usage examples.
  - Perform detailed performance profiling (Dar DevTools).
  - _ptimize pure _art code based on profiling.
   
  - *If necessary:* Investigate Da
- *   Refine API based on usability.
 
   **Goal:** Deliver a usable and reasonably performant package for Flutter developers.

```mermad
graph TD
    L[Package Library] --> M(Docs &Examples);
    M --> N(Performance Profilng);
    N --> O{Sufficient Perf?};
    O -- Yes --> P[API Refinement];
    O -- No -> Q(Investigate FFI);
   
``


-
- Linear Algebra module (`linalg`).
- Random number generation (`random`)
- Advanced indexing (boolean, fancy).
   Integration with other Dart libraries.


-
 
 
- **Performance:** Achieving near-NumPy performance in pure Dart will be diffic
 ult, especially for large datasets
   **API Complexity:** Faithfully replicating the breadth and nuances of NumPy's API is a significant undertaking.


-
- Start development from scratch.
- Prioritize core array features and ma
- Use `TypedData` for internal storage
- Adopt a phased development approach.
