# Active Context: NumDart (As of 2025-04-04 ~23:10 Europe/London)

## Current Focus

- **Resolved the negative step slicing bug** by correcting the `stop` index
  handling in `Slice.adjust`.
- All existing tests, including those previously skipped due to the slicing bug,
  are now passing.
- Preparing to decide on the next development step.

## Recent Changes

- Fixed negative step slicing bug in `lib/src/slice.dart`.
- Removed `skip` flags from relevant tests in `test/src/indexing_test.dart`.
- Updated `memory-bank/progress.md` to reflect the bug fix.
- Added and removed debug print statements during investigation.

## Next Steps (Decision Pending)

- **Option 1:** Implement slice assignment (extending `operator []=`). This
  involves handling broadcasting.
- **Option 2:** Begin Phase 2 by implementing basic element-wise mathematical
  operations (e.g., addition).
- **Option 3:** Implement other utility methods like `toString()` or `copy()`.

## Open Questions / Considerations

- Prioritization between implementing core math functions (Phase 2 start) vs.
  more complex assignment/view logic (slice assignment).
