# Active Context: NumDart (As of 2025-04-04 ~23:15 Europe/London)

## Current Focus

- **Implemented scalar slice assignment** for `operator []=`.
- Added helper methods `_getViewDataIndices` and `_assignScalarToView` to
  `NdArray`.
- Added comprehensive tests for scalar slice assignment.
- All tests are currently passing.

## Recent Changes

- Extended `operator []=` in `lib/src/ndarray.dart` to handle slice assignment
  with scalar values.
- Added helper methods `_getViewDataIndices` and `_assignScalarToView`.
- Added new test group 'NdArray Slice Assignment (operator []= with scalar)' to
  `test/src/indexing_test.dart`.
- Updated `memory-bank/progress.md`.
- Fixed error handling logic in `operator []=` for slice assignment.

## Next Steps (Decision Pending)

- **Option 1:** Implement **NdArray slice assignment** (assigning an NdArray to
  a slice, requires broadcasting).
- **Option 2:** Begin Phase 2 by implementing basic element-wise mathematical
  operations (e.g., addition).
- **Option 3:** Implement other utility methods like `toString()` or `copy()`.

## Open Questions / Considerations

- Prioritization between implementing core math functions (Phase 2 start) vs.
  completing slice assignment (NdArray assignment with broadcasting).
