# Active Context: NumDart (As of 2025-04-04 ~23:03 Europe/London)

## Current Focus

- Completed initial implementation and testing of core `NdArray` creation
  functions (`array`, `zeros`, `ones`, `arange`, `linspace`), basic integer
  indexing/assignment (`operator []`, `operator []=`), basic slicing
  (`operator []`), and the `reshape` method.
- Just completed a "Update Memory Bank" task, creating and populating the core
  documentation files.
- Preparing to decide on the next development step.

## Recent Changes

- Implemented `reshape` method (returning views).
- Added tests for `reshape`.
- Updated `README.md` and `memory-bank/progress.md`.
- Created `.gitignore`.
- Created `memory-bank/productContext.md`, `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md`,
  `memory-bank/techContext.md`.
- Committed and pushed all recent changes to GitHub.

## Next Steps (Decision Pending)

- **Option 1:** Implement slice assignment (extending `operator []=`). This
  involves handling broadcasting.
- **Option 2:** Begin Phase 2 by implementing basic element-wise mathematical
  operations (e.g., addition).
- **Option 3:** Revisit and attempt to fix the known bug in negative step
  slicing.
- **Option 4:** Implement other utility methods like `toString()` or `copy()`.

## Open Questions / Considerations

- How to best debug the negative step slicing issue without reliable print
  output in the test environment?
- Prioritization between implementing core math functions vs. more complex
  assignment/view logic.
